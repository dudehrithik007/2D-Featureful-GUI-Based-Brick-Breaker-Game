# Game in Java: Brick-Breaker Game
The presentations are attached for details. Limited comments (due to time constraints), hence will be making a video maybe soon explaining the whole program. References are given in the code.  This code is mine and is utterly modified and is made into a "wholly new game". For honesty: No offense to anyone, this was a minor group project in which more than 85% to 90% of coding/testing in it as well as the presentations were done/made by me. The code has some anomalies which I took care of but not absolutely. The anomalies' basis lies in the ball-bar as well as the in the ball-brick collisions. Will try to make a video explaining all of them soon whenever time permits me.  If you want an explanation beforehand, please write to me at: hrithikchugh007@gmail.com

2D, GUI & Featureful. Database connectivity. The unique & new features: vertical bar movement & segmented bar.
Only a basic game without any features has been seen on the Internet specifically in Java.
